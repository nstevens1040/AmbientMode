# AmbientMode
Just like Chromecast Ambient Mode, but for Roku. This is source code for a Roku app written in SceneGraph and BrightScript that cycles through (as of now) 55 pictures, displays the current date, time, and outdoor temperature in the lower right corner.  
# Weather data
To display current weather conditions, an API call to **api.weather.com** is used. The API is hosted by **[IBM Passport Advantage Weather Company Data](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/environmental-intel-suite?topic=reference-weather-data-apis)**.
